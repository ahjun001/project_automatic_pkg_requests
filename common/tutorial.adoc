= Automatic_pkg application tutorial
This tutorial is a step-by-step instruction on how to produce a user-ready package request to be sent to TST supplier factories. As it has been designed to entirely replace in-person training sessions, it is important that each step is understood and acquired before going to the next one.  Steps 1 to 5 are a series of introductory demonstrations with limited hands-on exercices.  Following steps explains the details of each functions.Please ask PJ if any question arises.

== Starting the program

****
This step describes starting the program and getting familiar with its environment.
****

On your PC 桌面-Desktop, double-click image:start_icon.png[icon file is missing, 50, 50] , a link to the automatic_pkg.bat batch file.

This should open a DOS window with 3 general areas, as follows:

* Area 1 -- "Information": +
The first 3 lines, terminated with ---------- 
+
.Selected contract and templates to create packaging labels
image::area_1.png[area_1 missing]
+
In Figure 1, we will use data from contract A911001-022 to produce labels based on 'a.Outer_box_外相' and 'b.Inner_box_內盒' templates

* Area 2 -- "Menu":
One paragraph, headed with >>>, presenting a series of menu options. +
Each entry starts with a single or double key stroke to perform the indicated action. 
+
.Menu
image::area_2.png[area_2 missing] 

* Area 3 -- "Key-in": +
Key-in your command and press kbd:[Enter回车]
+
.Key-in area
image::area_3.png[area_3 missing]

[IMPORTANT]
====
NOW TRY THIS:

* kbd:[3] kbd:[Enter]
* The first two lines are a confirmation of the selection that you have made: at this point, it should read the following:

 Option 3 selected
 ~~~ Step 3: Selecting fields to print for each template ~~~

* Observe how, right below these first two lines, Area 1 -- "Information" has changed
* Keep reading on, check the sub-menu
* You may choose kbd:[b] to come back to the preceeding menu, or kbd:[d] to check if external programs have been set properly
* kbd:[b] will get you back one menu level, kbd:[q] will exit the program, have a try!
====

[NOTE]
====
If you exit the program, but still have the DOS window open.  The command prompt being preceeded with <venv3.8>, you can start again with:

`> a[utomatic_pkg.bat]`
 
or

`&gt; a` image:tab.png[Tab]

If the DOS prompt is not preceded with <venv3.8>, then exit this window and start again from the beginning.
====

****
Having completed this step, you should be able to enter the program, understand which 
elements have been selected, navigate menus, and exit. +
See PJ if any questions.
****

== Demo: overviewing the program and how it uses external applications

****
This step describes how to get acquainted with automatic_pkg capabilities. 
****

* From the >>> Main Menu: , enter kbd:[1]kbd:[Enter 回车]

[WARNING]
====
2 windows open: `tk` & `打开` +
If not, the windows may be hidden below.
====

* Open `打开 / A011001-022 / A011001-022 哈特惠 DIN58+DIN934 Feb. 26, 2020 TY.xls`
* Once this is done `tk` can be closed or minimised.

[WARNING]
====
Check that the selected contract is now A011001-022. +
If not, run again. +
Two templates have been selected: `a.Outer_box_外箱`， and `b.Inner_box_內盒`
====

* Enter kbd:[0] to create a pdf package request with values selected as indicated +
A series of browser windows and a pdf file will open. +
Browser windows contain the following:
** a single copy of templates, populated with contract data
** multiple copies of templates, self-arranged on the same page, populated with contract data
** The header page, using copies of the first template in the list
** Finally, assembled pages of the package request

[WARNING]
====
Each browser page opens a link that points to a .svg file:  `'file:///C:/Users/Admninistrator/...'`.

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, an open format that allows files to be modified with a text editor or with Inkscape if needed.
====

* Close all the browser files.  A quick way to do this is as follows:

 Right-click on `Task bar / Browser's icon` 
 Left-click `关闭所有窗口`

* Now take a look at `A011001-022.pdf`, the package request document. +
One might say that information is there, but the presentation could be more compact: margins are too wide.

* Open `link:../data/A011001-022/A011001-022_doc_setup.json[../data/A011001-022/A011001-022_doc_setup.json]` with a text editor.

A way to do this follows:

 Right-click the link / Save link as ...
 Open 记事本-Notepad / Ctrl-O  & Paste

.Editing a contract document setup file
image:无标题_1.png[无标题_1.png is missing]

* Modify both margins width & height (`margin_w` & `margin_h`) from `25` to `15`.
* This is an opportunity to turn off having a cover page and to create an offset on the first page, so let's try this:
** Modify `cover_page` from `true` to `false`
** Modify `page_1_vert_offset` from `0` to `100`

.Editing a contract document setup file
image:无标题_2.png[无标题_2.png is missing]

* Save the file and get back to the DOS command `automatic_pkg.bat` window
* Close all browser files, all pdf files and enter kbd:[0] to run again.

Margins have been corrected, cover page is now not included, and a space of 100 is now available as header on the first page.

****
This step has demonstrated the overall architecture of the program: using external browsers, pdf viewers, inkscape Scalable Vector Graphic editor, and text editor to rapidly produce a simple package labels request.
****


== Demo: presenting how the program re-uses existing work

****
This step shows how existing templates can be easily modified to produce new labels.
****

* Labels that have been successfully produced are stored in the `link:../contract_samples[../contract_samples]` repository

* In the previous step, when we selected a contract to be processed, the program made a copy of the `link:../contract_samples/A011001-022[../contract_samples/A011001-022]` directory into the `link:../data[../data]` directory, so as to create a working environment to modify elements without loosing past realisations.

* Using the automatic_pkg, open a new sample contract: A911008-008
** Start automatic_pkg
** kbd:[1] to select a contract
** Select A911008-008 folder and then double-click on the only ...xls file present in this directory
** In the Reporting part of the screen, we observe that some Processing has been effected on this file. In fact, information from the .xls file has been extracted so that it can feed the Inkscape templates. +
+
.Correctly processing xls data before feeding it to the templates is only indicated with one line
image:processing.png[processing.png is missing]
* kbd:[0] to create the pdf package labels request
* Close all browser windows, as we don't need them at this point.
* Observe the pdf package request for A911008-008 contract: very similar to the one for A011001-022 contract.  Here is how to go from the existing one to the new one.

[WARNING]
====
* Open an Inkscape window and open `link:../data/A011001-022/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg[../data/A011001-022/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg]`
* Open a separate Inkscape window and open `link:../data/A911008-008/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg[../data/A911008-008/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg]`
* The two templates only differs in:
** Product designation in French & English
** PI number
** Product picture
* All other variable data, extracted from the corresponding xls contract files, will be automatically processed using the same name variables, such as ${xl_prod_specs}, ${prod_n}, ${mat2_fr} and so on.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Observe the purple-Fuchsia-FF00FFF color box around the drawing & text.  This box tells the program the space to reserve for a label. As text comes from the XL file, it cannot be measured ahead to position labels on the page and the program will reserve the place corresponding to this box. +
Keep in mind that this box and everything Fuchsia or of the same FF00FF color will be erased from the file before producing the final pdf.
====

****
This steps introduced the ../data directory, where work is performed, and an overall description of a label's template.
****

== Demo specifics

****
This step presents functions that complete automatization of the tasks necessary for a delivery ready label request. +
These features all come from turning the corresponding field name from `false` to `true` in template files `template-info.json`, such as link:../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/template-info.json[../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/template-info.json]
****

=== Adding pictures
* Select the A006045-001 contract.
* Having checked that data processing has normally completed, create the pdf deliverable.
* Open link:../data/A006045-001/[../data/A006045-001/]
* Check that this request uses one template `a.Outer_box_外箱`.
* Ctrl+click on `A006045-001.pdf`, check that to each label corresponds a picture.
* Pictures are stored in a sub-directory of the template definition, see `link:../data/A006045-001/a.Outer_box_外箱/pics[../data/A006045-001/a.Outer_box_外箱/pics]`.
* Pictures are linked to product in the file `link:../data/A006045-001/a.Outer_box_外箱/template-info.json[../data/A006045-001/a.Outer_box_外箱/template-info.json]`.
* Each product listed has the following:
** a svg picture file, 
** the (x, y) coordinates to position the upper left angle of the picture in the label,
** a coefficient to size the picture.
* If none of the label need pictures, the field is just turned to `false` in `template-info.json`.  This is the case in `link:../data/A011001-022/a.Outer_box_外箱/template-info.json[../data/A011001-022/a.Outer_box_外箱/template-info.json]`. Check `"pictures:  false"`.

=== Adding barcodes


=== Automatic French translations
Most data in xls contract files is in Chinese.  Some fields should show up in French on labels. As, for example, in contract `A006043-001`:

* `label_template.svg` publishes data in Chinese, with field names end in _zh, such as `${field_name_zh}`. Using the corresponding field `${field_name_fr}` data will be automatically replaced with their French equivalent.
+
[cols="1,1",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
a|.`label_template.svg` extract
image::template_with_zh_n_fr.png[template_with_zh_n_fr.png is missing]
a|.`label request` extract
image::zh_fr_deliverable.png[zh_fr_deliverable.png is missing]
|===
+
Translations are stored in link:../common/zh_fr.json[../common/zh_fr.json].

=== Reformatting extracted data
Some of the data that already exists in xls contract files is not correctly formatted for package labels requests. For example, for contract `A006045-001`:
* In the xls contract file, `Product specification-产品规格` is formatted as `2050x820 mm`, `2050x920 mm`, and so on. 
+
.`A006043-001 美信 防盗门 Mar. 24, 2020 TY.xls` extract
image::Prod_spec-产品规格.png[Prod_spec-产品规格.png is missing]
* This information was extracted in `A006043-001-contract.json` in the same format.
+
.`A006043-001-contract.json extract`
image::A006043-001-contract.json.png[A006043-001-contract.json.png is missing]

* However, the desired format is `H. 2050 x l. 820 mm`, `H. 2050 x l. 920 mm`, and so on, as seen on the deliverable.
+
.`A006043-001.pdf` extract
image::A006043-001.pdf.png[A006043-001.pdf.png is missing]
* So as to re-format the `"03.Prod_spec-产品规格"` data, pre-processing is specified in `template-info.json`, creating a new field named `width`
+
.`a.Outer_box_防盗门侧唛/template-info.json` extract
image::pre_processing.png[pre_processing.png is missing]
and then all products specifications can be correctly formatted. 
+
* Then the newly created `width` field can be readily used in `label_template.svg`
+
.Using `width` in `label_template.svg`
image::width_in_label_template.svg.png[width_in_label_template.svg.png is missing]
+
====
TIP: It would also be easy to fix this directly from the contract data in SAP, writing specifications under the desired format for each product.
====

=== Dealing with data that is not available for all products
Some contracts have product specifications that do not consistently appear in all products of the xls contract file. +
So as to differentiate product data that is missing by mistake and product data that is not populated by design, these data fields are specified in `template_info.json`
* In `A006043-001` contract the "亚光-mat" and "亮光-brillant" is not present in all products, but when it is, it is important that it should be on the product label.
* This information is passed on to the program simply by mentionning `gm_zh`, the 'gloss-mat' field in the `template-info.json` / `"partially_populated_fields"` list.
+
.`label_template.svg` extract
image::partially_populated.png[partially_populated.png is missing]
====
TIP: It would also be easy to fix this directly from the contract data in SAP, populating all specifications fields for each product.

== Tutorial: building your own package request: from A000001-start to A000001-final -- Overview

****
This proposes a progressive elaboration of a conceptual yet realistic package label request, using a new capability of the program at each step.
****

* In automatic_pkg, select A000001-start
* Using the internet browser, `right-click Open in a New window `link:../data/A000001-start[../data/A000001-start]`
* In the root page, click on `link:../data/A000001-start/A000001-start_doc_setup.json[../data/A000001-start/A000001-start_doc_setup.json]`.
to check global setup for the final document.  This was introduced in <<Demo: overviewing the program and how it uses external applications>>
* Still in the root page, click on `link:../data/A000001-start/A000001-start-contract.json[../data/A000001-start/A000001-start-contract.json]`.  Check that all data from the xls contract file has been extracted and reformated in JSON format in this file.

* Still using the internet browser, `right-click Open in a New window `link:../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱[../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱]`
* Click on `link:../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/template-info.json[../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/template-info.json]`. +
All fields indicated in this file are modifiable in a text editor if needed. Fields can be added to the "selected_fields" list, "template_header" can be edited +
Fields set to `false` will be further filled with default values after being turned to 'true' and processed by the program.
* Come back to the template directory and click `link:../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg[../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg]` to view the label template. +
3 fields -- xl_prod_spec, u_parc, and parc,  from the "selected_fields" list from template_info.json are being used in a ${field} format +
Other fields such as ${t}, ${i}, ${prod_n} are not in template_info.json.  These are common to all package requests and don't need to be specified each time +
${t} is the number of the template in the order used in the final document. Typically 1, 2, or 3. +
${i} is the rank of the product label being printed.  In this case from 1 to 8 as there are 8 products.
${prod_n} is the product number. Here, from `AA00001` to `AA00008`

* in automatic_pkg, run kbd:[0]
* a series of .svg files have been created and show in browser pages and a .pdf
* `link:../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/.1_product.svg[../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/.1_product.svg]` shows how data from the first product in the xls contract file is processed into a label. +
This page shows that all automatic information -- ${t}, ${i}, ${prod_n} was inserted correctly, and that the selected data -- ${xl_prod_spec}, ${u_parc}, and ${parc} also was correct.  Close this browser page.
* in automatic_pkg, run kbd:[3] and then kbd:[1] +
The page that we just closed has been created again.  Also created is a cover page using this first page as label examples. +
These two browser pages can be closed.

* `link:../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/.1_template_1.svg[../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/.1_template_1.svg]` and +

....

== How to: add French terms to be used as dynamic data in labels

* As for example, colors are specified in Chinese in the xls contract file -- `红，黄，黑， ...` and should appear in French -- `rouge, jaune, noir, ...` in the labels.
* Extract the information in Chinese with a variable ending in `_zh`, as for `color_zh` that appear in `link:../common/regular_expressions_local.json[../common/regular_expressions_local.json]`
* Then, the same variable name ending in `_fr`, as `color_fr` can be readily used as a label in `label_template.svg`, as in `link:../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg[../data/A000001-start/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg]`
* Translations are stored in `link:../common/zh_fr.json[../common/zh_fr.json]`, add new translations as needed using the same formats.
* As for other JSON files, make sure each record is separated from others with a `,` comma, and that the last one is not followed by any `,` comma.
* Another example, less easily described but as pertinent, is shown in `link:../data/A006045-001/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg[../data/A006045-001/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg]`, where `${ens_prt_zh}` identifies products for the supplier factory, and `${ens_prt_fr}` identifies products for French speaking customers.

....
To be continued
....


== Tutorial: building your own package request from scratch

*Step 1 select a contract*

* In automatic_pkg, select a xls contract file.
* Open your file browser to the `link:../data[../data]` directory, tune it so that hidden files cannot be seen
* Check that a new directory, typically name with the `Axxxxxx-xxx` contract ID number has been created
* Move to that directory and check the following elements:
** A copy of the initial xls contract file. +
+
Information missing from the contract should be replaced in SAP +
Then, a new xls file exported from SAP and selected from automatic_pkg to replace this one. 
** A `Axxxxxx-xxx_doc_setup.json` contract that could be modified to:
*** Change final document margins
*** Toggle standard cover page
*** Set a vertical offset on the first page so that, using Inkscape, specific recommandations to the supplier can be inserted.
*** See <<Demo: overviewing the program and how it uses external applications>> for more information about modifying these.
** A `Axxxxxx-xxx-contract.json` file that contains the information from the xls contract file, in a format that allows to be further processed.

*Step 2 load or create templates to print*

* Either use the program to select a template directory from `link:../common[../common]`
* Or use the file browser to select an existing template directory to copy into the `../data/Axxxxxx-xxx` directory.
* Edit files in this new copied directory
** Use Inkscape to edit label_template.svg
*** Insert all necessary information as static data
*** Identify data that should be dynamic, typically the one unique to each product.

*Step 3 select fields to print for each template*

* Check in the top 'Information' area for a column that contains the information needed
* In label_template.svg replace static data with column heading, using ${field_name} as a format

Getting a new column of data in the top 'Information' area

* With 记事本-Notepad, or any other text editor, open `..\data\Axxxxxx-xxx\Axxxxxx-xxx-contract.json`, copy the entire content of the file
* Open `link:https://regex101.com[https://regex101.com]`. Check Flavor as `*Python 2.7*`  (*Python 2.7* should appear as bold characters and followed by a check sign)
* Open `link:../common/regular_expressions_local.json[../common/regular_expressions_local.json]`, identify data headings such as the ones in the first rows: 'pack', 'parc' (for parcel), 'u_parc' (for under parcel), or others that are already in the 'Information' area of the program.
* For example, for 'pack', copy the `how` part of the search -- (?<=外包数：)\\d+\\.\\d+ and paste this in `regex101.com` / REGULAR EXPRESSION
* In that windows change every backslash '\\' into a single one '\' +
A small green message should appear right on top of the REGULAR EXPRESSION, indicating the number of match for this search, which typically should be the number of product in the contract. +
The right part of `regex101.com` shows `EXPLANATION` -- how this search reaches its match, `MATCH INFORMATION` -- content and character positionning for each match, and `QUICK REFERENCE` -- which shows how the regular expressions can be formulated. Once again, for this to work, make sure that `*Python 2.7*` has been checked. 
* Using these examples and explanation, create a search -- `"what"` and `"how"` that you will further add as a new line to `link:../common/regular_expressions_local.json[../common/regular_expressions_local.json]`
* If this information is in Chinese in the xls contract file, but should show up in French on labels, then give a name to this new information that ends with `_zh`.  The program will look for translation and make it available as a comparable name ending with '_fr' in `label_template.svg` files.

....
Information showing on the label request is important and should be clearly identifiable in the contract. +
Tidying up the information within SAP is also a way to ease this information extraction.
....

* Before saving `link:../common/regular_expressions_local.json[../common/regular_expressions_local.json]`, make sure that every search line is separated from the others with a comma `,` and that the last line does not end with a comma `,`
