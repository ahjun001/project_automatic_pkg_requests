= Automatic_pkg application tutorial
This tutorial is a step-by-step instruction on how to produce a user-ready package request to be sent to TST supplier factories. As it has been designed to entirely replace in-person training sessions, it is important that each step is understood and acquired before going to the next one.  Please ask PJ if any question arises.

== Starting the program
[.lead]
This step describes starting the program and getting familiar with its environment.

On your PC 桌面-Desktop, double-click image:start_icon.png[icon file is missing, 50, 50] , a link to the automatic_pkg.bat batch file.

This should open a DOS window with 3 general areas, as follows:

* Area 1 -- "Current selections": +
The first 3 lines, terminated with ---------- 
+
.Selected contract and templates to create packaging labels
image::area_1.png[area_1 missing]
+
In Figure 1, we will use data from contract A911008-008 to produce labels based on 'a.Outer_box_外相' and 'b.Inner_box_內盒' templates

* Area 2 -- "Menu":
One paragraph, headed with >>>, presenting a series of menu options. +
Each entry starts with a single or double key stroke to perform the indicated action. 
+
.Menu
image::area_2.png[area_2 missing] 

* Area 3 -- "Key-in": +
Key-in your command and press kbd:[Enter回车]
+
.Key-in area
image::area_3.png[area_3 missing]

[IMPORTANT]
====
NOW TRY THIS:

* kbd:[3] kbd:[Enter]
* The first two lines are a confirmation of the selection that you have made: at this point, it should read the following:

 Option 3 selected
 ~~~ Step 3: Selecting fields to print for each template ~~~

* Observe how, right below these first two lines, Area 1 -- "Current selections" has changed
* Keep reading on, check the sub-menu
* You may choose kbd:[b] to come back to the preceeding menu, or kbd:[d] to check if external programs have been set properly
* kbd:[b] will get you back one menu level, kbd:[q] will exit the program, have a try!
====

[NOTE]
====
If you exit the program, but still have the DOS window open.  The command prompt being preceeded with <venv3.8>, you can start again with:

`> a[utomatic_pkg.bat]`
 
or

`&gt; a &#11134;`

`&gt; a` image:tab.png[Tab]

If the DOS prompt is not preceded with <venv3.8>, then exit this window and start again from the beginning.
====

[.lead]
Having completed this step, you should be able to enter the program, understand which 
elements have been selected, navigate menus, and exit. +
See PJ if any questions.

== Discovering what the program can do
This step describes how to get acquainted with automatic_pkg capabilities. 

* From the >>> Main Menu: , enter kbd:[1]kbd:[Enter 回车]

[WARNING]
====
2 windows open: `tk` & `打开` +
If not, the windows may be hidden below.
====

* Open `打开 / A011001-022 / A011001-022 哈特惠 DIN58+DIN934 Feb. 26, 2020 TY.xls`
* Once this is done `tk` can be closed or minimised.

[WARNING]
====
Check that the selected contract is now A011001-022. +
If not, run again. +
Two templates have been selected: `a.Outer_box_外箱`， and `b.Inner_box_內盒`
====

* Enter kbd:[0] to create a pdf package request with values selected as indicated +
A series of browser windows and a pdf file will open. +
Browser windows contain the following:
** a single copy of templates, populated with contract data
** multiple copies of templates, self-arranged on the same page, populated with contract data
** The header page, using copies of the first template in the list
** Finally, assembled pages of the package request

[WARNING]
====
Each browser page opens a link that points to a .svg file:  `'file:///C:/Users/Admninistrator/...'`.

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, an open format that allows files to be modified with a text editor or with Inkscape if needed.
====

* Close all the browser files.  A quick way to do this is as follows:

 Right-click on `Task bar / Browser's icon` 
 Left-click `关闭所有窗口`

* Now take a look at `A011001-022.pdf`, the package request document. +
One might say that information is there, but the presentation could be more compact: margins are too wide.

* Open `link:[../data/A011001-022/A0111001-022_doc_setup.json]` with a text editor.

.Editing a contract document setup file
image:无标题_1.png[无标题_1.png is missing]

* Modify both margins width & height (`margin_w` & `margin_h`) from `25` to `15`.
* This is an opportunity to turn off having a cover page and to create an offset on the first page, so let's try this:
** Modify `cover_page` from `true` to `false`
** Modify `page_1_vert_offset` from `0` to `100`

.Editing a contract document setup file
image:无标题_2.png[无标题_2.png is missing]

* Save the file and get back to the DOS command `automatic_pkg.bat` window
* Close all browser files, all pdf files and enter kbd:[0] to run again.

Margins have been corrected, cover page is now not included, and a space of 100 is now available as header on the first page.

This step has demonstrated the overall architecture of the program: using external browsers, pdf viewers, inkscape Scalable Vector Graphic editor, and text editor to rapidly produce a simple package labels request.
