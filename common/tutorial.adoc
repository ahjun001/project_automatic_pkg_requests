= Automatic_pkg application tutorial
This tutorial is a step-by-step instruction on how to produce a user-ready package request to be sent to TST supplier factories. As it has been designed to entirely replace in-person training sessions, it is important that each step is understood and acquired before going to the next one.  Steps 1 to 5 are a series of introductory demonstrations with limited hands-on exercices.  Following steps explains the details of each functions.Please ask PJ if any question arises.

== Starting the program
[.lead]
This step describes starting the program and getting familiar with its environment.

On your PC 桌面-Desktop, double-click image:start_icon.png[icon file is missing, 50, 50] , a link to the automatic_pkg.bat batch file.

This should open a DOS window with 3 general areas, as follows:

* Area 1 -- "Current selections": +
The first 3 lines, terminated with ---------- 
+
.Selected contract and templates to create packaging labels
image::area_1.png[area_1 missing]
+
In Figure 1, we will use data from contract A911001-022 to produce labels based on 'a.Outer_box_外相' and 'b.Inner_box_內盒' templates

* Area 2 -- "Menu":
One paragraph, headed with >>>, presenting a series of menu options. +
Each entry starts with a single or double key stroke to perform the indicated action. 
+
.Menu
image::area_2.png[area_2 missing] 

* Area 3 -- "Key-in": +
Key-in your command and press kbd:[Enter回车]
+
.Key-in area
image::area_3.png[area_3 missing]

[IMPORTANT]
====
NOW TRY THIS:

* kbd:[3] kbd:[Enter]
* The first two lines are a confirmation of the selection that you have made: at this point, it should read the following:

 Option 3 selected
 ~~~ Step 3: Selecting fields to print for each template ~~~

* Observe how, right below these first two lines, Area 1 -- "Current selections" has changed
* Keep reading on, check the sub-menu
* You may choose kbd:[b] to come back to the preceeding menu, or kbd:[d] to check if external programs have been set properly
* kbd:[b] will get you back one menu level, kbd:[q] will exit the program, have a try!
====

[NOTE]
====
If you exit the program, but still have the DOS window open.  The command prompt being preceeded with <venv3.8>, you can start again with:

`> a[utomatic_pkg.bat]`
 
or

`&gt; a` image:tab.png[Tab]

If the DOS prompt is not preceded with <venv3.8>, then exit this window and start again from the beginning.
====

[.lead]
Having completed this step, you should be able to enter the program, understand which 
elements have been selected, navigate menus, and exit. +
See PJ if any questions.

== Overviewing the program and how it uses external applications
This step describes how to get acquainted with automatic_pkg capabilities. 

* From the >>> Main Menu: , enter kbd:[1]kbd:[Enter 回车]

[WARNING]
====
2 windows open: `tk` & `打开` +
If not, the windows may be hidden below.
====

* Open `打开 / A011001-022 / A011001-022 哈特惠 DIN58+DIN934 Feb. 26, 2020 TY.xls`
* Once this is done `tk` can be closed or minimised.

[WARNING]
====
Check that the selected contract is now A011001-022. +
If not, run again. +
Two templates have been selected: `a.Outer_box_外箱`， and `b.Inner_box_內盒`
====

* Enter kbd:[0] to create a pdf package request with values selected as indicated +
A series of browser windows and a pdf file will open. +
Browser windows contain the following:
** a single copy of templates, populated with contract data
** multiple copies of templates, self-arranged on the same page, populated with contract data
** The header page, using copies of the first template in the list
** Finally, assembled pages of the package request

[WARNING]
====
Each browser page opens a link that points to a .svg file:  `'file:///C:/Users/Admninistrator/...'`.

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, an open format that allows files to be modified with a text editor or with Inkscape if needed.
====

* Close all the browser files.  A quick way to do this is as follows:

 Right-click on `Task bar / Browser's icon` 
 Left-click `关闭所有窗口`

* Now take a look at `A011001-022.pdf`, the package request document. +
One might say that information is there, but the presentation could be more compact: margins are too wide.

* Open `link:../data/A011001-022/A011001-022_doc_setup.json[../data/A011001-022/A011001-022_doc_setup.json]` with a text editor.

A way to do this follows:

 Right-click the link / Save link as ...
 Open 记事本-Notepad / Ctrl-O  & Paste

.Editing a contract document setup file
image:无标题_1.png[无标题_1.png is missing]

* Modify both margins width & height (`margin_w` & `margin_h`) from `25` to `15`.
* This is an opportunity to turn off having a cover page and to create an offset on the first page, so let's try this:
** Modify `cover_page` from `true` to `false`
** Modify `page_1_vert_offset` from `0` to `100`

.Editing a contract document setup file
image:无标题_2.png[无标题_2.png is missing]

* Save the file and get back to the DOS command `automatic_pkg.bat` window
* Close all browser files, all pdf files and enter kbd:[0] to run again.

Margins have been corrected, cover page is now not included, and a space of 100 is now available as header on the first page.

[.lead]
This step has demonstrated the overall architecture of the program: using external browsers, pdf viewers, inkscape Scalable Vector Graphic editor, and text editor to rapidly produce a simple package labels request.


== Presenting how the program re-uses existing work
This step shows how existing templates can be easily modified to produce new labels.

* Labels that have been successfully produced are stored in the link:../contract_samples[../contract_samples] repository

* In the previous step, when we selected a contract to be processed, the program made a copy of the link:../contract_samples/A011001-022[../contract_samples/A011001-022] directory into the link:../data[../data] directory, so as to create a working environment to modify elements without loosing past realisations.

* Using the automatic_pkg, open a new sample contract: A911008-008
** Start automatic_pkg
** kbd:[1] to select a contract
** Select A911008-008 folder and then double-click on the only ...xls file present in this directory
** In the Reporting part of the screen, we observe that some Processing has been effected on this file. In fact, information from the .xls file has been extracted so that it can feed the Inkscape templates. +
+
.Correctly rocessing xls data before feeding it to the templates is only indicated with one line
image:processing.png[processing.png is missing]
* kbd:[0] to create the pdf package labels request
* Close all browser windows, as we don't need them at this point.
* Observe the pdf package request for A911008-008 contract: very similar to the one for A011001-022 contract.  Here is how to go from the existing one to the new one.

[WARNING]
====
* Open an Inkscape window and open link:../data/A011001-022/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg[../data/A011001-022/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg]
* Open a separate Inkscape window and open link:../data/A911008-008/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg[../data/A911008-008/a.Outer_box_外箱/label_template.svg]
* The two templates differs in:
** Product designation in French & English
** PI number
** Product picture
* All other variable data, extracted from the corresponding xls contract files, will be automatically processed using the same name variables, such as ${xl_prod_specs}, ${prod_n}, ${mat2_fr} and so on.
* Observe the purple-Fuchsia-FF00FFF color box around the drawing & text.  This box tells the program the space to reserve for a label. As text comes from the XL file, it cannot be measured ahead to position labels on the page and the program will reserve the place corresponding to this box. +
Keep in mind that this box and everything Fuchsia or of the same FF00FF color will be erased from the file before producing the final pdf.
